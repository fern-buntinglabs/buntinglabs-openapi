        This endpoint downloads features from OpenStreetMap based on tags and
        optionally a bounding box, resulting in a GeoJSON.

        This API extracts features from the OpenStreetMap database and formats
        them as GeoJSON.

        You can filter for any tag in the database, either as `key=value` or
        `key=*`, and can chain tags if you need 2+ tags.

        This endpoint is especially useful for extracting map data directly to
        user applications (like the browser) or as a faster alternative to
        [Overpass Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) and the [Overpass
        API](http://overpass-api.de/).
      operationId: OsmService.extractFeatures
      tags:
        - Osm
      parameters:
        - name: tags
          in: query
          description: >
            This is a list of tags in the form `key=value` to filter features
            for. All features extracted will satisfy each of the passed tags
            given by this parameter.

            This tag list can be created by forming an array of `key=value`
            items and joining them into one string with the `&` character.

            Because both = and & are reserved characters in URIs, this list must
            be URL encoded.

            An example list of tags could be `leisure=park` and `name=Westglen
            Park`. This matches parks that have the name Westglen Park. To set
            this parameter, we’ll URL encode leisure=park&name=Westglen Park.

            Documentation on tags can be found on the
            [TagInfo](https://docs.buntinglabs.com/openstreetmap-api/count#:~:text=found%20on%20the-,TagInfo,-resource%20website)

                    Welcome to Japantown, a vibrant and diverse neighborhood in
                    San Francisco! The area is known for its many nearby Asian
                    restaurants, and the convenience of having a Safeway right
                    around the corner for all your grocery needs. The
                    neighborhood is highly educated, with 29% of residents
                    holding masters degrees. The area is very walkable and
                    densely populated with 3-story buildings. The average home
                    in the area sells for $1.2M. The nearby public schools are
                    rated as 5/10, it may not be the best option for families
                    with school-aged children. But for those that work in the
                    Financial District, the SFMTA 24 and 38 buses provide good
                    transit options into the city. This is a great neighborhood
                    for those looking to be in the heart of the city, with easy
                    access to all that San Francisco has to offer.
